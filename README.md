# StellarMotion-MATLAB-Project

In this project I am using MATLAB to find the observed wavelength of the Hydrogen alpha line of a star and compare it to known wavelength of hydrogen absrobtion to determine how fast the star is moving away from earth. Just like a siren sounds higher as it comes near and lower as it moves away, a star spectrum is blue shifted (of shorter wavelength) when it is moving towards earth and red shifted (of longer wavelength) when it is moving away from us.

Additional information: With precise spectrum measurements over time astronomers use this technique to discover the slight oscilllations that demostrate the presence of planets. Using the star data of the spectrum of HD94028. HD94028 is a faint star from the constellation of Leo, whose diffraction grating results will guide towards the motion. When the sunlight strikes the star it produces a spectrum in which the information of the diffraction grating gives a clue about the star properties. With the help of this spectrum, we can get the spectrum graph of HD94028. The graph has several spikes which denotes the color radiation. The more the spike is, the less is the radiation. The deep spike denotes the amount of hydrogen mixed in that particular are.
